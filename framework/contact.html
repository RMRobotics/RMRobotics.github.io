			Describe what this contact method is for (general questions, messaging your teacher/mentor, etc.) and how to use it. For example, on <a href="http://rmrobotics.com/contact">our page</a>, the first section is for general questions and offers a link to our main team email address.

			Use additional sections to add additional contacts. For example, if you want to allow visitors to contact a team email or a mentor, or if you want to allow visitors to contact specific mentors, you can put different contact details in different sections.
