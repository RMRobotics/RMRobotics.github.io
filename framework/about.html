			<p><a href="http://www.usfirst.org">FIRST</a> (For the Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a non-profit organization founded by <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Kamen">Dean Kamen</a>, a successful inventor whose 25 year mission has been to change American culture to make becoming a scientist or engineer as desirable as being an actor or professional athlete. FIRST operates four robotics programs:
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/jr.fll">Jr. FLL</a>- Jr. FIRST LEGO League, for grades K-3</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/fll">FLL</a>- FIRST LEGO League, for grades 4-8</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/ftc">FTC</a> and <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc">FRC</a>- FIRST Tech Challenge and FIRST Robotics Competition, both primarily for students in high school</li>

			<p>The FIRST Tech Challenge is a secondary school robotics competition, where teams of approximately ten students work together to build a robot to complete a series of challenges released each September. Teams are also tasked with promoting STEM education and the growth of FIRST in their communities. Teams can compete locally, at the state level, at one of four "super-regional" events (within the US), and at the World Championship held each April in St. Louis, MO, with a combination of judged awards and robot performance determining which teams are able to advance to the next level of competition.</p>
