			<div class="header">What is FIRST?</div>
			<hr/>
			<p><a href="http://www.usfirst.org">FIRST</a> (For the Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a non-profit organization founded by <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Kamen">Dean Kamen</a>, a successful inventor whose 25 year mission has been to change American culture to make becoming a scientist or engineer as desirable as being an actor or professional athlete. FIRST operates four robotics programs:
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/jr.fll">Jr. FLL</a>- Jr. FIRST LEGO League, for grades K-3</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/fll">FLL</a>- FIRST LEGO League, for grades 4-8</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/ftc">FTC</a> and <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc">FRC</a>- FIRST Tech Challenge and FIRST Robotics Competition, both primarily for students in high school</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<div class="header">What is FTC?</div>
			<hr/>
			<p>The FIRST Tech Challenge is a secondary school robotics competition, where teams of approximately ten students work together to build a robot to complete a series of challenges released each September. Teams are also tasked with promoting STEM education and the growth of FIRST in their communities. Teams can compete locally, at the state level, at one of four "super-regional" events (within the US), and at the World Championship held each April in St. Louis, MO, with a combination of judged awards and robot performance determining which teams are able to advance to the next level of competition.</p>
			<p>We're currently awaiting the release of the 2014-15 season robot game. Please check back here for an overview after September 6th when the game is revealed!</p>

			<div class="header">What are Teams 5421 and 8121?</div>
			<div class="subheader">Team 5421</div>
			<hr/>
			<p>Team 5421, "RM'd and Dangerous," is RM Robotics' senior team. Made up of students from all grade levels, the 12-member team has grown tremendously during its four-year existence. Boasting a mere seven members and receiving a wildcard slot at a state championship in its first season, the team has earned a spot at the Maryland Championship in each of the past three seasons through consistently strong performance in local events. Last year, the team won its longest-ever list of awards:
			<ul>
				<li>1st Place Overall at State Qualifier</li>
				<li>3rd Place Overall at Maryland State Championship</li>
				<li>Best Community Outreach at Maryland State Championship</li>
				<li>3rd Place Overall at East Super-Regional Championship</li>
				<li>Best Industrial Design at East Super-Regional Championship</li>
				<li>2nd Place Overall at 2014 World Championship</li>
				<li>Best Overall in US at 2014 World Championship</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<br/>
			<div class="subheader">Team 8121</div>
			<hr/>
			<p>Team 8121, "RMageddon" (formerly the "Combustible Lemons"), was formed in the 2013-14 out of unprecedentedly strong interest in the RM Robotics program. RMageddon's 12 members were primarily first and second-year students with little to no robotics experience, adding challenge to the already demanding FTC season. Despite this, the rookie team performed well, earning a spot at the Maryland State Championship by winning 2nd Place Overall at a local event.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>RM Robotics has said goodbye to five graduating seniors, but its remaining members are busy preparing to welcome a new group of recruits. We're looking forward to the prospects of an even more successful year!</p>
